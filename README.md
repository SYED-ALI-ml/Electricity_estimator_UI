# Electricity Estimator UI ⚡️
An intuitive web app for predicting household electricity consumption using a pre-trained LSTM model.

## 🚀 Overview
**Electricity Estimator UI** is a user-friendly application built with **Streamlit** that allows users to estimate electricity usage based on inputs such as appliance usage, number of residents, and environmental conditions. It uses a pre-trained **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** model for time-series-based electricity prediction.

This tool is ideal for researchers, students, and homeowners interested in monitoring or forecasting power usage patterns.
